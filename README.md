### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm just a guy who believes everyone should use a Raspberry Pi as their daily, desktop PC. Few developers share this dream and as a result, the desktop experience of Raspberry Pi OS is lacking.  
Rather than complain to the Raspberry Pi developers, I became one myself.  

My first project was [vdesktop](https://github.com/Botspot/vdesktop) - basically virtualbox but it runs on a Raspberry Pi. This command-line tool was the first RPi-compatible application capable of interacting with the virtual machine's **graphical desktop session.**  
Next came [Pi Power Tools](https://github.com/Botspot/Pi-Power-Tools). This application is a suite of tools for creating and modifying Raspberry Pi OS disk-images and SD cards. This was the first application I made with a GUI interface.  
Pi Power Tools never became as popular as I had expected it to, so I took a step back and questioned **what people really *wanted***. Did they want a utility to create & manage operating systems with virtual machines? Apparently not.  
Then what did they want? **Software.** In hindsight, I wonder how I missed it before - after all there are thousands (if not *millions*) of Raspberry Pi tutorials! The vast majority of these tutorials explain **how to install 3rd-party software on your Pi**. Unfortunately nowadays, most of these tutorials don't work anymore because they were written in the Raspbian Stretch era.  
I thought to myself, "*If only someone maintained a centralized collection of tutorials?* What if those tutorials had a 'Run script' button? And what if you could easily undo the changes it made with an 'Uninstall' button?"  
Thus, [Pi-Apps](https://github.com/Botspot/pi-apps) was born.  
In early 2020 it was a small application that I never imagined would see widespread use. But slowly, word spread through the community that there is finally a convenient alternative to tutorials. Soon it was added to Twister OS and not long after, Pi-Apps was featured by all the large RPi YouTubers.  
Today, Pi-Apps has over 100 apps and likely serves over 500,000 users though it's hard to know for sure.  

It turns out Pi-Apps was just the beginning. Over time I found additional software niches that nothing could fill.
